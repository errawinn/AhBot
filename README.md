# AhBot
Ahbot is a medical robot created for XiaoBai, a GoWild Singapore robot, for the Splash Awards 2018. 

It is a smart virtual healthcare assistant and mobile application developed with AI technology, targeted towards elderly who are often alone at home and tend to forget their medications or take wrong dosages. 

It also acts as a medical database to store health-related information about the elderly, to recommend useful health tips while chatting with them.

This version of Ah-bot was created for the first judging session of the competition.
